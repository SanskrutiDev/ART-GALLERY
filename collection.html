<left><h1>1. About Art - What Is It?</h1></left>
<left><p>
This question pops up often, and with many answers. Many argue that art cannot be defined. We could go about this in several ways. <br>
Art is often considered the process or product of deliberately arranging elements in a way that appeals to the senses or emotions.<br>
 It encompasses a diverse range of human activities, creations and ways of expression, including music, literature, film, sculpture and paintings.<br>
 The meaning of art is explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics. At least, that’s what Wikipedia claims.<br>
 <br>
 Art is generally understood as any activity or product done by people with a communicative or aesthetic purpose—something that expresses an idea,
 an emotion or, more generally, a world view.
 It is a component of culture, reflecting economic and social substrates in its design. 
 It transmits ideas and values inherent in every culture across space and time.
 Its role changes through time, acquiring more of an aesthetic component here and a socio-educational function there.

 <h1>2. The Evolution Of The Concept Of Art</h1>
 <left><p>While the definition of art has changed over the years, the field of art history has developed to allow us to categorize changes in art over time and
	to better understand how art shapes and is shaped by the creative impulses of artists.
	Having a solid grasp of art history, then, is important. I spoke with Alexander Daniloff and Jonathan Ball about the concept of art 
	through history and about whether tracing a line through traditional and contemporary art is possible.
	Alexander Daniloff is a Russian artist who lives and works in Italy. His focus is painting, although he has worked in several media. 
	Lately, he has worked on children’s illustrations. He has participated in various events and illustration competitions and has illustrated three books. 
	He has held numerous individual and group exhibitions in Italy, Russia, Holland, Spain, Finland and the US.

<h1>Creativity</h1>
<left><p>"Can you listen, as the soil receives the seed, and see if the mind is capable of being free, empty? It can
 be empty only by understanding all its projections and activities, not off and on, but from day to day, 
from moment to moment. Then you will find the answer; then you will see that change comes 
without your asking, that the state of creative emptiness is not a thing to be cultivated  it is there, 
it comes darkly, without any invitation, and only in that state is there a possibility of renewal, newness and revolution."
